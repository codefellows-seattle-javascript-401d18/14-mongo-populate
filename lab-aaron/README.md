### Makes A MongoDB Server involving children and dystopian toys...

Using a combination of Node.js, MongoDB, mongoose, superagent, Express, and several other npm packages that i will list below, i have created a Database with MongoDB.


The app will track the relationships between a gothic child and their somewhat morbid toys. Using POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests you can add, modify and remove children and their toys. What fun!

### Installation

* Fork this repository and clone that fork to where ever you like.
* Open your terminal and change your directory to the lab- file.
* Use the npm i command in your terminal to download all the packages.

### Using
* Use standard GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE calls using HTTPie, docs linked below, you can organize your emo kids and their toy collections.
